# Dynamic Programming

Memoization is a technique used to avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Used when ...
1. Can be divided into overlapping subproblems
2. Recursive solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblems?
4. Memoize subproblems
5. Bottom-up approach
