# Stack and Queue

## Stack
> better implemented with an array

LIFO (Last In First Out) 
- top: the index of the top element


### Time Complexity
| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Lookup | $O(n)$ |
| Pop    | $O(1)$ |
| Push   | $O(1)$ |
| Peek   | $O(1)$ |

## Queue
> better implemented with a linked list

FIFO (First In First Out) 

- front: the index of the front element
- rear: the index of the rear element

### Time Complexity
| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Lookup | $O(n)$ |
| Enqueue | $O(1)$ |
| Dequeue | $O(1)$ |
| Peek    | $O(1)$ |
